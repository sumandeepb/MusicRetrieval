# MusicRetrieval
Content Based Music Search and Retrieval

A project containing set of C++ Classes and usage code to extract features from a set of music files, index the data using k-means clustering for efficient search, and algorithm to return top best matching results based on query music file.

I developed the code during my undergraduate studies as a Guest Researcher at Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche
Intelligenz, Kaiserslautern, Germany in the summer of 2006. The work was carried under the supervision of Dr. Stephan Baumann.

Part of the code is borrowed and modified from MARSYAS library developed by George Tzanetakis. The project is released under GNU General Public License v3.0 as specified in the LICENSE file.
